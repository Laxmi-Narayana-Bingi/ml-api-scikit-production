# ml-api-scikit-production
A production-ready REST API that predicts customer churn (whether a telecom customer will leave) using scikit-learn. It has a clean FastAPI backend, Docker container, CI basics, great README, live deployment, and a 2-minute demo video by covering full lifecycle (data → model → API → container → cloud) in one clickable place.
